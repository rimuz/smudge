## The Smudge Programming Language - Documentation of box `std.lang`
The box `std.lang` is imported by default, because it contains all the methods of strings, lists and tuples.
## Warning
At the moment I'm still developing this box, so it's incomplete and unstable. However, all of the classes/functions documented in this page are **alredy** stable and tested.
