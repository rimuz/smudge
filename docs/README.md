# The Smudge Programming Language - Documentation
The Smudge Documentation (aka **SmudgeDocs**) has two different sections based
on who's directed to:
 - For the users (who develops in Smudge)
 - For the contriburors
 The SmudgeDocs will be competed in

## How to read the `SmudgeDocs`
The SmudgeDocs describe how do `classes`, `functions`, `vars` and `methods`work.

### Classes
Classes of boxes contained by the `SSL` work just like classes defined
in **your** boxes (or in third-parts boxes): you can **set** their methods,
**make instances** from them and, obviously, **call** its methods.
