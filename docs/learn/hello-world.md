# The Smudge Programming Language - Hello World

Let's write a simple Hello World program!
We write the following code in a file named `hello.sm`:
```js
import std.io = io;
func main(){
    io.println("Hello, world!");
}
```
And we call `smudge hello.sm`: *voil√†!* `Hello, world!` appears on the screen.
It's also possible to make the program directly executable by adding the
following line at the start of the file:
```js
#! /usr/local/smudge
```
This, called *hashbang* or *shabang*, it's a special Unix instruction that
tells the shell where is located the interpreter for the script.
Now it's possible to run it by simply typing `./hello.sm`.

This script is called **main script** (and its box the **main box**), because
it contains the **main** function.
As you can see, you can declare and define a function with the `func` keyword.
We'll depeen functions later.

When you run a program written in Smudge, you have to pass as argument to the
interpreter **only** the main script:
all other scripts are automatically found thanks to the **box system**.

The first line of the program **imports** the **box** `std.io` with the label
`io`.
**Boxes** are the Smudge way to make the code **modular**, **clear** and
**self-explaining**.
Each source file has its own box which can be imported from other boxes.
The import syntax is the following:
```js
import PATH.NAME = LABEL;
```
`PATH` cannot contain spaces and instead of *slashes* (i.e. `/`) it has
*dots* (i.e. `.`).
`NAME` is the name of the file whose box has to be imported. **Note**: each box
must have extension `.sm` (the **main box is an exception**), which is not part
of `NAME`.
`LABEL` is the name used by the current box as **link** to the imported box.

The same box **shouldn't** be imported in different ways (i.e. **different
`PATH`s**), but can be imported different times (with **different** link
**names**, obviously).
The **search directories** (i.e. the directories where the boxes are searched)
can be shown with the option `-s` or `--show-paths`.
Also, you can add new ones with the option `-D <directory>`. The first search
directory is **always** that folder where is contained the main script.

So, the import statement above, imports box contained in file `std/io.sm` with
the label `io`. Actually, there's no `std/io.sm` file because the **S**mudge
**S**tandard **L**ibrary is **native** (that doesn't mean non-customizable) but
you can write your own implementation of the **SSL** and install it in one of
the seach directories. You can disable the SSL with the option `-n` or
`--no-lib`.

The third line simply uses the box `std.io` (through its "link" `io`) by
calling its function `println` with the string `Hello, world!`. This functions
does nothing more than printing its **argument** and a **newline character**
(`\n`) to the `stdout`.

Now, it's time to do something more interesting!
